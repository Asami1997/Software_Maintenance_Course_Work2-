Day time and night time themes for game.
day time has normal animation: axe, boat, player, and water tiles fix
nighttime we change the player look and the map color, change the axe and boat 
how?
well the player has made all the sprites in a gif file in the game, 
if we re-color the sprites and put tose new ones in a seperate gif file and once a button is clicked, 
we can attach the 2 gif files to two different buttons.
